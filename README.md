Golang Result Monad library to easily manage errors

## :warning: Warning :warning:

This project requires Go generics which are still in development.

So this project is for experimental usage only.

## Result Monad

This library aims to ease the management of errors in Go using the `Either Monad` which can be either a `Success` (which contains a value), or a `Failure` (which contains an error).

Is it largely inspired by the `Result` class in `Kotlin`.

## Installation

Don't install it until Go generics are a thing.

## Usage
